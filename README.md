Reproducing Figures from "Biologically Informed Deep Learning to Query Gene Programs in Single-Cell Atlases"

This code is originally based on the scientific paper: "Biologically Informed Deep Learning to Query Gene Programs in Single-Cell Atlases".

While attempting to reproduce the results, we encountered compatibility issues with the updated version of scArches. Due to recent changes in the library, some parts of the original code required adjustments to function correctly with the new version.

In this repository, we've adapted the code to work with the updated version of scArches, focusing on replicating Figures 2 and 4 from the paper.
